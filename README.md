## Turtles all the way forward!
These turtles are not stacked on top of each other :-) they keep walking!

I'm using Turtle graphics to render a visual representation of L-systems, inspired by a work discussion about [this book and its cover](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45303387-an-elegant-puzzle) which looks related to the Barnsley fern!
